// The persistent per-character card POOL — the set of cards reward/shop offers sample from. The

// `Character.pool` stores the event/shop-granted extras AND verse (spirit) cards unlocked by studying a
// Scripture Fragment — so an unlocked verse card is offered like any other. Only the '+' upgrade
// variants (created by upgrading, never offered) are filtered out. Pure: sampling threads `run.rng` via
// `shuffle` — never Math.random.
